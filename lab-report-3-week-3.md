# Lab Report 3 # 

### The less command shows the contents of a file one screen at a time and is able to scroll through using certain keys
<br><br>
The syntax for the less command 
### 
```
less <file-name>
```
<br>

## **Three command options with exammples**

### 1) The first command option that will be demonstrated is the -N option

### It enumerates the results by line which is helpful considering that most times in terminal the lines are not enumerated. This makes scrolling though results much more practical 

```
less -N <file-name>
```

### An example of the -N option used on the technical directory search results for .txt files.
